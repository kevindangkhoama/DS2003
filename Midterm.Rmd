# Executive Summary
This report utilizes NBA data to create clear and informative plots that demonstrate differences in NBA seasons and positions. This report is geared towards readers looking to understand more about how different players perform in the playoffs vs during the regular season and which positions in the NBA let players have the most playtime. Stakeholders interested in this may be recruiters, coaches, or fantasy league players.

Our key findings were that though, average performance between player's performance in the playoffs and regular season were close, players tended to play slightly worse in the regular season than in the playoffs. There are many reasons for this which could include the playoffs being very high stakes as the NBA title is determined by them and that there are fewer games than in the regular season. We also found that the positions of power-forward and centers played the most games but also had the least playing time per game. We found this interesting and thought it may be a valuable thing for coaches to know as they plan substitutes.

```


# Background/Questions
As a group we found that we all had a common interest in basketball, especially with March Madness approaching. Additionally, it is simple to find stats tracking performance of players in sports. Knowing this, we explored some datasets on Kaggle and found an interesting one that included NBA stats on playoffs and regular seasons from 2021-2022.

We thought it would be interesting to see how a player's performance differs between the playoffs and regular seasons. The regular season is obviously a major part of the season and getting into the playoffs but we felt it was important to see how players stepped up to the pressure of being in the playoffs and winning when it mattered.This led to us wondering if there was a difference between a playerâ€™s position and how long they are able to remain in the league. For example, players who play a guard position are oftentimes shorter than someone who plays a position like a center. In general those who are taller seem to be less durable and we wanted to see if this applied in the NBA.

#### To make summary statistics
Made df with combined Playoffs and Regular season PTS, AST, TRB, and STL data for players who were in both.
```{r}
# first join dfs to delete players in the regular season that do not appear in the playoffs
joined_filtered <- merge(playoffs, regular, by='Player')

# now we made a subset of the joined dataframes that contains the relevant categories we want to look at for "success" in the NBA.
joined_subset <- joined_filtered %>%

         PTS.x, AST.x, TRB.x, STL.x,

# Question 1 Plot & Narrative
### Question
> How does NBA success translate from playoffs to the regular season?

### Plot
```{r}
# plot facet-wrapped graph
ggplot(nba_pivot, aes(Player, regular, color = "Regular")) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(aes(Player, playoffs, color = "Playoff")) +
  facet_grid(Stat ~ ., scales = "free_y") +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Season", values = c("Regular" = "steelblue", "Playoff" = "red")) +
  labs(title = "Regular Season vs Playoff Season Averages") +
  labs(x = "", y ="") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```          

### Narrative
Despite the few outliers most players performed close to their regular season averages in the playoffs. Although most of the averages went down from the regular season to the playoffs. This could contribute to the fact that the level of play increases in the playoffs, especially defensively, as the playoffs are what truly matters when it comes to winning. If the NBA wants all players to play at their peak level throughout the season and not just the playoffs then they might want to think about reducing the amount of games during the regular season. This graph is mainly directed towards NBA analysts and NBA coaches. A lot of analysts discuss who will show up in the playoffs and if they will fail to perform under the pressure. These graphs could provide good insight on who might over perform or under perform when it comes to the playoffs. This graph may also provide good information to coaches when considering who to trade for or sign later in the season if they want a better chance at winning the NBA finals. 


# Question 2 Plot & Narrative
### Question
> What positions are the most durable (played for the longest and for the most games) in a regular season?

### Plot
#### Box plot of games played for each position (Regular season)
```{r}
#boxplot
ggplot(regular_b1, 
       aes( x = Position, 
            y = Games_Played,
            )) +
  geom_boxplot(color='#0B1D51', fill='steelblue', alpha=0.5) +
    labs(
    title = 'Games Played Based on Position',
    caption = 'Kaggle, 2021-2022 NBA Player Stats
    Center = C
    Center-Power Forward = C-PF
    Power Forward = PF
    Power Forward-Small Forward = PF-SF
    Point Guard = PG
    Point Guard-Shooting Guard = PG-SG
    Shooting Guard = SG
    Shooting Guard-Point Guard = SG-PG
    Shooting Guard-Small Forward = SG-SF') +
  xlab('Position') +
  ylab('Games Played') +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Box plot of minutes played for each position (Regular season)
```{r}
#boxplot
ggplot(regular_b2, 
       aes( x = Position, 
            y = Minutes_Played_Per_Game,
            )) +
  geom_boxplot(color='#0B1D51', fill='steelblue', alpha=0.5) +
    labs(
    title = 'Minutes Played Per Game Based on Position',
    caption = 'Kaggle, 2021-2022 NBA Player Stats
    Center = C
    Center-Power Forward = C-PF
    Power Forward = PF
    Power Forward-Small Forward = PF-SF
    Point Guard = PG
    Point Guard-Shooting Guard = PG-SG
    Shooting Guard = SG
    Shooting Guard-Point Guard = SG-PG
    Shooting Guard-Small Forward = SG-SF') +
  xlab('Position') +
  ylab('Minutes Played per Game') +
  theme_minimal()
```


### Narrative
We thought that it would be good to see what positions played the most games per season to test durability. While this was a good graph we also were curious about the minutes played per game, due to the fact that someone may play a lot of games despite playing few minutes per game. These two box plots did present interesting data as Shooting Guard-Point Guard position was a position that played a lot of games per season on average compared to many others, but despite that the median amount of minutes played per game was much closer to other positions medians. This data could have big implications on the stakeholders (the NBA coaches). These graphs can tell the coaches that although some positions could be the most important part of a team, a team may also want the most substitutions for those respective positions as they are the least durable/can handle less play time throughout a single game.
